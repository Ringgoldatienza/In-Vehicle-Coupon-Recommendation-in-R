Hi! This is my second capstone project for the Harvard University Data Science Professional Certificate.

For this project, I created a machine learning model to predict whether a driver will accept a coupon or not using three classification algorithms, namely
the classification and regression tree (CART) model, random forest, and XGBoost. The results showed that XGBoost provides the highest F1 score. Meanwhile, since the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, it is assumed that both precision and recall are equally valued. However, in reality, some companies prefer precision (cost efficiency) than recall (wider reach) or vice-versa.
